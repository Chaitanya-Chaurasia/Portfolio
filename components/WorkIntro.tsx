          A lot of people I have spoken to tend to use the words &quot;job&quot;
          and &quot;work&quot; interchangeably. Well, I agree to disagree on
          this one. To me, &quot;working on something&quot; means putting in
          physical or mental effort to achieve a goal. The goal could lie
          anywhere on a vast spectrum- from something matereliastic, monetary in
          value to something as abstract as success or satisfaction.

          Often, people get so immersed in their jobs that they start equating
          them with work. I&apos;m not saying that couldn&apos;t be the case, if
          it is, I think you&apos;re on the right track.

          If not, I urge everyone to take a step back

          and think about what they truly want to achieve in life. Identify your
          goals and start working towards them. That&apos;s what I call real
          work.

          I&apos;m not alone in this beliefâ€” it&apos;s advice I&apos;ve received
          from many successful individuals.

          My passion lies in creating unique, state-of-the-art solutions. One of
          my ultimate goals is to develop something sustainable.

          Our planet is facing significant challenges, and contributing to a

          fulfilling for me.
