          Most people I make conversation with tend to interchange the words
          &quot;job&quot; and &quot;work&quot;. I implore them to retrospect. To
          me, work should be a harbinger of jubilation- something that gets you
          out of your bed every morning. The goal could be anything. Think of it
          as a spectrum that includes a multitude of desires- from something
          materialistic, monetary in value to something as abstract as success
          or satisfaction.
          <br />
          <br />
          So often, people get so immersed in their jobs that they start
          equating it with work. I&apos;m not denying saying that couldn&apos;t
          be the case; if it is, you&apos;re on your way to become successful.
          <br />
          <br />
          If not, I urge everyone to take a step back and ponder.

          Think about what you truly want to achieve in life. Identify your
          goals and start working towards them. Now that&apos;s what I call real
          work.
          <br />
          <br />
          And don&apos;t quote me on thisâ€” it&apos;s advice I&apos;ve received
          from only so many successful people.

          My passion lies in creating unique, state-of-the-art solutions that
          deliver innovation and impact at scale. To give an idea, one of my
          goals is to contribute towards achieving sustainability.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our planet is facing significant challenges, and contributing to a
          solution that benefits future generations would be incredibly
          fulfilling for me.
