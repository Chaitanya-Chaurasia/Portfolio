          A lot of people I have spoken to, tend to use the words "job" and
          "work" interchangeably. Well, I agree to disagree on this one. To me,
          "working on something" means putting in physical or mental effort to
          achieve a goal. The goal could lie anywhere on a vast spectrum- from
          something matereliastic, monetary in value to something as abstract as
          success or satisfaction.

          Often, people get so immersed in their jobs that they start equating
          them with work. I'm not saying that couldn't be the case, if it is, I
          think you're on the right track.
          <br />
          <br />
          If not, I urge everyone to take a step back

          and think about what they truly want to achieve in life. Identify your
          goals and start working towards them. That's what I call real work.

          <br />
          I'm not alone in this beliefâ€”it's advice I've received from many
          successful individuals.

          My passion lies in creating unique, state-of-the-art solutions. One of
          my ultimate goals is to develop something sustainable.

          Our planet is facing significant challenges, and contributing to a

          fulfilling for me.
