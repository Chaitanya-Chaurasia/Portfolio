            This summer, I'm at IDEXX, working with the Chemistry team on
            designing internal tools for testing a fleet of machines called
            "Autocats." Autocats are a fleet of vetenary machines used to
            prognose, diagnose and run sophisticated health tests.

            I am developing an full-fledged API in C# (ASP.NET) and Bash, that
            enables communicating with these remote devices, enabling software
            installation, running remote tests, testing, remote health checkups
            and machine maintainance. I hope to deploy this feature before the
            end of my term. (hopefully :)) ðŸ¤ž

            In terms of productivity and learning, this has been an exceptional
            experience. From the interview process, to getting onboarded, and to
            now almost finish, everything was so smooth and professional. I
            think I was able to level up my inter-personal skills, better
            communication for example, and also my technical prowess. I learnt a
            lot, and also got a chance to meetup with the Best Seller "Keith
            Ferrazzi." If I could rate it, a 12/10.
