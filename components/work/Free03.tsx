        Two things I really enjoy apart from work, is to travel and capture moments I've lived. Its truly a priviledge to travel, explore what different parts of the world have for me. I've been fortunate to have lived and visited different parts of the world whilst growing, and I'm really grateful for the experiences and memories I have carried. 
        At my home, we have a Canon 3000D, nothing fancy, but really comes handy. I'm still a rookie, which is why I keep learning and, on top of that, do it because I enjoy pursuing it. Find some of my clicks below.
