          Life has really been benign to me. It has given me more than I could ever
          have asked. To reciprocate this respect, I have come to the conclusion
          that they are <span className="italic">management</span> and{" "}
          <span className="italic">mindset</span> that differentiates the
          successful from the ordinary.

          Over the past few years in college, I have evolved from a rookie to,
          well let me put it this way, an accomplished tyro (get the pun?) when it comes to the
          two very indispensible skills. With time, I have adopted a versatile
          mindset, that has enabled me to evolve as a person, learn and become
          accomplished in new skills and to achieve excellence in whatever I
          indulge in.
          <br />
          <br />I believe that time, like a wise old owl, guides us to the best
          of our ability. It has taught me that when we are 
        </span>
