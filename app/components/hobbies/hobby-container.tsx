              Reflecting over my brief yet a rich &amp; diverse past, I&apos;ve
              held firm to the belief that everyone should nurture a certain
              creative side, a certain imaginative side that encourages you to
              think like the &quot;little you&quot; within, think outside the
              box and that lends you a new lens to view the world with. This is
              what I think a hobby builds within oneself. After all, life&apos;s
              brevity compels me to seize every moment, exploring every avenue
              that might enrich my existence. The hobbies and pursuits I&apos;ve
              engaged in over the years have not only shaped my personality but
              also stand as a testament to the diverse paths our lives can take.
              It&apos;s through these endeavors that we often stumble upon our
              true passions, perhaps even defining what we ultimately choose to
              do with our lives.

            Exploring my Curiosity
          </span>
          <span className="text-[15px]">
            Imagine a world devoid of curiosity. A world where Newton, struck by
            a falling apple, felt no urge to unravel the mystery of its descent.
            A world where Neanderthals remained in perpetual darkness, never
            questioning the spark that could ignite from friction. This inherent
            human desire to explore and understand fuels progress. Engineering
            thrives on the relentless pursuit of unraveling complex systems, and
            its true beauty lies in its ability to bridge disciplines.
            Thankfully, information is more accessible than ever, acting as a
            springboard for curious minds like yours. This ever-growing well of
            knowledge allows me to delve into diverse concepts and
            collaboratively push the boundaries of discovery. Therefore,
            curiosity isn&apos;t merely a privilege; it&apos;s the very
            lifeblood of human advancement, the fire that ignites the path
            towards a brighter future.

              Movies have always been a cornerstone of my upbringing. My dad has
              always stressed upon their importance in broadening our horizons
              and nurturing creativity. He believed, and I&apos;ve come to
              agree, that they&apos;re not just entertainment but a vital tool
              for enhancing our creative intellect. Through the art of cinema,
              we&apos;re invited into diverse worlds, exposed to different
              perspectives, and inspired by the endless possibilities of
              storytelling. This has ingrained in me a deep appreciation for
              film as a powerful medium for education, empathy, and, most
              importantly, envisioning the limitless bounds of our imagination.
